  - Primary, Foreign, Candidate, Composite, Unique
- Practiced all major SQL command groups:
  - DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL
- Implemented joins:
  - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF
- Worked with complex queries:
  - Subqueries and correlated subqueries
  - EXISTS and derived tables
- Learned advanced SQL concepts:
  - Window functions
  - CTE and recursive CTE
  - Transactions and isolation levels
- Studied indexing in detail:
  - Primary, Unique, Composite, Full-Text indexes
  - Clustered and non-clustered indexes

### 🗓 Day 35 – JDBC Fundamentals & Database Connectivity  
**(Date: 09-Feb-2026)**

  - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Compared `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement` and learned SQL injection prevention.
- Practiced ResultSet processing and data retrieval.
- Learned transaction management concepts:
  - Auto-commit, commit, rollback, savepoints
- Followed JDBC best practices:
  - Try-with-resources
  - Proper exception handling
  - Secure query execution
- Introduced DAO and DTO design patterns for database applications.
- Solved JDBC practice programs and committed all work.
